"""
Compliance Advisor API — exposes the control-advisor toolkit (previously a PowerShell/CLI tool)
over HTTP so the whole "scan -> answer questions -> get documents" flow runs from the browser.

Pipeline (mirrors control-advisor/cli.py, minus the blocking input()/print()):
  detect environment -> scan (network or cloud) -> map discovered categories to NIST 800-53
  controls (RegMap embedder) -> an adaptive interview (rendered as a browser form) -> prioritize
  -> generate DOCX / XLSX / JSON reports for download.

Design notes:
  * The interview questions are static/adaptive data (interview.ENVIRONMENT_QUESTIONS +
    FOLLOWUP_QUESTIONS with deterministic triggers). We serve them as a form and evaluate the
    triggers server-side, so we skip the CLI's slow LLM free-text interpretation entirely.
  * The LLM narrative steps (executive summary, drafted policy language) are SLOW and need Qwen;
    they are OPTIONAL (with_language) and degrade to a templated summary when unavailable, so the
    core flow is fast and works even without the LLM in the image.
  * Authorization reuses securescan.authz (loopback/private by default; SCAN_ALLOW_ANY to opt in),
    unified with the SecureScan tool.
  * control-advisor imports its modules by bare name, so we add its `scanner/` dir to sys.path.
